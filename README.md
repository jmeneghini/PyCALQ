# PyCALQ
Correlator Analysis and Luscher Quantization Condition.

Full analysis chain of the finite volume spectrum from two-point correlators to phase-shifts and other infinite-volume observables using the LÃ¼scher formalism

Pipeline:
- first we pick operators to fit correlation functions
For NN analysis: There are 3 steps
  - single nucleon stability study
  - two-nucleon stability study
  - phase-shift analysis

Questions
- what is a data handler? 
- Best tasks for both data handling and analysis
- Exact steps for analyzing correlator data?
