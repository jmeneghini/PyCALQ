# Lüscher Scmüscher
Full analysis chain of the finite volume spectrum from two-point correlators to phase-shifts and other infinite-volume observables using the Lüscher formalism

Pipeline:
- first we pick operators to fit correlation functions
For NN analysis: There are 3 steps
  - single nucleon stability study
  - two-nucleon stability study
  - phase-shift analysis
  - 

Questions
- what is a data handler? I will look into that (Jo)
- what does raw LQCD data look like, how is it handled? Comes in hdf5 files usually, so data handler has to know about keys ...
- Is h5py as output to get LQCD data the best way? (down the road)
